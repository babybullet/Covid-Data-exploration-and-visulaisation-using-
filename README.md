This project is all about extracting a tons of insights about covid related information using SQL Server Management Studio(SSMS) 
and afterwards visualization of insights has been depicted using a visual analytical platforme Tableau.
I have divided the whole dataset into two parts named as covid_death which includes informations regarding death and their count and 
other one as covid_vaccination which includes information about how many people got vaccinated along with place , time and location sing
Microsoft Excel and then processed the data with the help of SSMS queries.
